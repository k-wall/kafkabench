* Different cluster sizes?
  * Development - 1 broker - 1 zk
  * Standard - 3 broker - 3 zk
  * Large - 10 broker - 3 zk
  * Mega - 20 broker - 5 zk

* Configurations:
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. broker memory
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. broker cpu
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. ISR

* Can we use anti-affinity to prefer broker and ZK of clusters to not co-locate?

* Tools:
  * Openmessaging-benchmark seems useful to easily configure test scenarios and measure impact
