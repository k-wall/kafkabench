* Different cluster sizes? Example:
  * 1 broker - 1 zk
  * 3 broker - 3 zk
  * 10 broker - 3 zk
  * 20 broker - 5 zk

* Test Configurations?
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. broker memory
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. broker cpu
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. network bandwidth
  * Producer and consumer throughput vs. ISR (in-sync replicas)

* Measure
  * Throughput
  * Latencies (what is acceptable before we consider it to be degradation?)


* Considerations
  * Use anti-affinity to require broker and ZK of clusters to not co-locate
  * What set of vCPU and memory is cost-effective for the different cluster sizes?
  * How well does Kubernetes isolate kafka brokers once they have been setup with limits?
  * What is the network capacity and what is reasonable bandwidth limits for different configurations?

* Tools:
  * Included scripts are nice for one-off testing, but requires lot of tooling to be built around to easily reproduce tests.
  * Openmessaging-benchmark seems useful to easily configure test scenarios and measure impact.
